# Weather-Application
In this particular challenge I had to create a weather app that not only displays a specific city but also saves the city in its local storage. I was also supposed to use an API in order to get this information. After finding the API I was able to grab the data I needed and plug it into my placeholders that were already in my HTML. Then I was able to display all my local storage on my webpage to enhance the user experience. I did face some challenges it was not smooth sailing because I was having trouble saving the data in my local storage but after some patience and perserverance I was able to get it to work.
